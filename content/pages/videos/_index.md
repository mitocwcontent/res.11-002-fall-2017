B. Stephen Carpenter II, Ida Ely Rubin Artist in Residence at the MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology (CAST), and Lawrence Susskind, Ford Professor of Urban and Environmental Planning, combined art, science, and social practice to demonstrate how to enhance practices and possibilities for sustainability through socially engaged art and education.

During his fall 2017 residency, Carpenter provided new perspectives on issues of access, privilege, and the global water crisis (particularly in Africa and Central America) through a series of seminars, performances, and workshops. The series, entitled _Intentional Public Disruptions: Art, Responsibility, and Pedagogy_, provided an opportunity for students, faculty, and the MIT community to work with Carpenter and learn about his approach to socially engaged art and education. He also modeled how social practice (as action researchers, artists, educators, and activists) offers possibilities to disrupt systems of oppression and ways to increase access to potable water in politically marginalized communities in the United States and abroad.
